1. implement a java method boolean is_prime(N) 
=> static boolean is_prime(int N){
    for(i=0; i<1000; i++)
    {
        for(n=0; n<i; n++)
            if(i%n==0) 
                return false;
            else 
                return true;
        }
    }
}
2. What is XPath and what is use of it in WebDriver?
=> X-path is used to select nodes or node-sets in an xml document.We use xpath to to find dynamic element in webdriver.

3. How do you write a locator to identify paragraph elements that are the immediate child of a div element, or the descendent of a div element? 
=> //parenttag[@attribute ='value']//tagname[@attribute='Value']

5. Please list the automation tools that you have used
=> SeleniumRC, Selenium, Selenium webdriver, TestComplete ,Framework TestNG, Maven, Jenkings, Selenium grid, Cucumber, 

6.What is Test Environment?
=> It is where software application is deployed and executed,basically environment is needed to host any kind of application .

4.what is 4 tier deployment environment ?
=> a) devlopment --> accessed by devlopers 
   b) Test --> Accessed by Testers(manual feature testing only
    i) Regression --> Accessed by Testers(automation testing mostly)
   c) Staging --> Accessed by internal business team and client 
   d)Production --> accessed by end user 
   
5. What are the common Environment issue you face when you testing?
=> Configuration : File is not up-to-date or wrong configuration 
   Database: missing/failed deploy script.missing or bad data 
   Servers : Firewall/proxy issues.Wrong software version issue 
   Other : Environment not available 

6.How does your typical day at the work look like in your last company?
=> any project specific tasks and constant collaboration with different group of people like dev,devops,project manager in order understand gain 
   knowledge on the requirement,Write proper test cases,In order to perform day to day testing activities.
   
7.What test environment do you have?
=> Established test env QA/System testing,Regression   

8.Mention few challanges or issues you face everyday?
=>Environment issues,Unclear req's,deployment issues etc

9.What is agile and how it is executed?
=>
  Agile model 
  -------------    Features
  Analysis         .Iterative and incremental
  ----------       .Needs lot of collaboration
  Design           .Customer constantly sees subsets of product 
  -------
  coding           waterfall drawback addressed:
  -------          .Reduce risks
  Testing          .Allows changes
  -------
  Release
  --------
  Agile is a approach for software development.It goes to the phases as like waterfall but the phases are divided into the iteration.It means 
  the whole project is divided into separate set of features that can be developed and delivered independently.only one or two phases are worked 
  on each iteration.Each feature or couple of feature goes into the SDLC as part of each iteration and will be released.Each iteration that can be 
  developed and delivered to the customer independently.It iteration divided into sprints and usually between 2-4 weeks and number of iteration depends
  on the Size of the project.It needs a lot of collaboration between dev and Qa because each iteration is a complete implementation of SDLC phases.
   
10.What is Agile Testing ?
=> It means following Agile principles.
   a) Testing isnt a seperate phase but continues: It means development happens in iterations usually in 2 week cycles,Test engineer continuesly work 
      along with the developers or product owner.Here QA looks at the requirement,Prepare test plan and test cases gets any clarification , set Test 
	  Environment and begins to test the application it a continue process.
   b)Shorter cycle execution and provide faster feedback: This is challenge for the testers , If there is any requirement changes into core feature then 
     it comes comes quickly into the testing 	 
   c)Testing isn't just raising bugs,but preventing them: Throw continues collaboration between everybody involved tester will be more proactive rather then
     reactive in identify bug and raise them also helping product owner to making any requirement changes and helping devloper handling any node 
     use cases etc

11.What is scrum?
=> is a execution framework for Agile.Scrum is a popular framework which execute Agile principles and it is currently implemented in most of the 
   company.Scrum defines certain roles,Artifacts in order to implement agile.
  
    Roles:
    product owner -> Is responsible for talking to stakeholders writing the requirement into multiple user stories
    Scrum Master -> is reponsible for all the events into the scrum and resolving any blockers team might face 
    Team(Developer/QA)	
	
	Arifacts:
	->User Stories : is a description and a feature to be developed in testing,It is the responsibility of the produt owener to create User stories.Product 
	 owner create some requirement and create multiple user stories.Each user stories have dev and QA to work on it 
	->Tasks: it is created under a user stories,For eg dev create 2 tasks for development and unit testing.QA Engineer can create two more tasks under 
      same user stories one task is to create a test cases and other is to execute.So under a user stories dev and QA create multiple tasks  
    ->Sprint backlog:Consists a pipeline of user stories order by priority and can be worked on next sprints,These are created and pritioze by 
      product owener and agreed by the team that they will be able to work on them	
	  
	Events:As we know agile used iteration, In scrum this iteration is called as sprints 
	->Sprint iteration (2 weeks usually)
    ->Sprint planning meeting(Conducted beginning of sprint)
   	->Daily stand up meeting 
	->Sprint review meeting (Conducted end of the sprint)->Features worked on the current sprint demonstrated to the stakeholder in QA or staging environment
	->Sprint retrospective meeting(Conducted end of the sprint)-> Facilitate by a scrum master and takes feedback from the team

12.What is sprint as a tester standpoint?
=>Sprint is a time box effort,QA should be proactive and reactive.Tester is accepted to finish the work in the stupilated time	
   Estimation:
   Check any dependency,Consider pre-requisites:test data setup,tools installation etc 
   Requirement:
   learn quickly and ask for clarification only, req change:re estimate and re-work test cases
   Blockers: raise flag early on so that it can be resolved early 
   
13.Describe the challanges with Agile testing ?
=>Contineous,time boxed and shorter test execution cycles,limited documentation 

14.How do you handle requirement changes ?
=>work closely with PO and estimate the work of requirement change,So in that scenerio i create generic test plan, And if there is any major changes into
  the application with Product owner handle in the next sprint   

15.What is compile time and runtime?
=>Compile time is when .java file is build into .class file by java compiler
  Runtime is when the .class file is executed by JVM  
  
16.What are local,instance and class variable?
=> local variable: Created at the beginning of the method execution and destroyed at the end of the method execution
   scope: Visible only in the method or block is decleared 

   Instance variable/member variable: Created when an object is created and destroyed when the object is garbage collection
  Scope: visible to all the method in the class and createed per each object class 

  Static variable:created when the program starts(loaded by JVM ) and destroyed when the program quits 
  scope: visible to all the method in the class and created per class 

17.What are stack and heap?
=>Stack and heap are 2 primary area used by JVM 
  Stack-> Method and local variable(both primitive and reference variable) are stored into Stack
  Heap-> Object and instance variable are stored in heap
  
18.What is WebDriver in selenium?
->Webdriver is the name of key interface in selenium against which tests should be written 
 -Webdriver implementation classes include(but not limited to)
   firefox,chrome etc

19.Why webdriver needs different driver executables from browers vendors?
=> WebDriver makes a direct call to browser through browser native support for automation(binary executable file)
   the executable act as a bridge/proxy between the "driver" and the "browser"
