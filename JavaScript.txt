1 what is javascript?
=> javascript is a light weight,cross platform,Object oriented computer programming language. It means lightweight does use computer memory,Cross 
   platform means it can be used in multiple platform and system and language based on object.
   javascript is one of the three core techonology of web development 
   javascript is mostly commonly used as a part of webpages but it also used without RAM  
    this is actually run on client side: it is traditionally only used in the browser 
	Server side: Thanks to node JS , we can use javascript on the server as well 
  javascript is what made modern web development possible 
  .Dynamic effects and interactivity 
  .Modern web development that can intreact with 
  There are tons of javascript libary and frameworks out there they are specilized in different factors and help develpoers to write complex application
  Library like jQuery,frameworks like react and angular

2 where does JS fit in ?
=> we know HTML is for UI  CSS is to handle those and JS is for Dynamic effect into the HTML

3.How do you write a code ?
=> open Brackets =>Start a new project or import a new project.There is a 2 ways to write a JS one is inline code and another is <script> tag,creating a 
   new file called JS at the end 
   Eg for inline <script>Hello world!!</script> In line code example 
   moslty we prefere to write into a JS file <script src="script.js"></script>
   to print console.log('Hello world!!');
  
4.How do you define data type and variables in JS?
=> To create a variable 
    var name ='Megh';
	console.log(name);
	
5. What are the primitive data types in JS?
=> Number : floating point number,For decimal and integer(In JS it always have decimal like float ) 
   String: Sequence of character,used for text
   Boolean: Logical data type that can only be true or false 
   undefined : Data type of a variable which does not have value 
   NUll : also means non existence  
   Primitive which means these are  not objects 
  JS has a dynamic typing which you dont have to specify what datatype when you are creating a value.JS will figure out on the run 
  
 6.how do you comment code ?
 Sigle line comment // and block comment is multi line comment /* */ 
	
 7.what happen if you mix string and int?
=> var name ='Megh';
var age =37;

console.log(name+age); // JS will figure out which data type needs to convert automatically this is called typeCoertion 

8.How do you create multiple variables ?
=> var job, ismarried;

console.log(job);//This will give undefined because variable is undefined.
We can assign variable after the variable is declared 

9.What is variable notation?
=> It means changing the variable data types 

10.How do prompt an alert into a JS?
=> var newName=prompt('What is you name?');
console.log(newName);

12.How do you alert in JS?
=> alert("abc")

13.What are the operators in JS?
=> +,-,*

14.How do you define IF else statement?
=> var name ='Megh';
 var age =26;
 var ismarried='no';

 if(ismarried === 'yes'){ === this is a comparison operator
    console.log(name+' '+ 'is not married');
}else{
    console.log(name+ ' '+ 'is married');
}

14.What are the basic boolean logic ?
=> AND(&&)-> true if all are true
 ,(||)-> true is one is true
  (!)not->inverts true or false value
  
15.What is function and how do you create it?
=>  Is a container which holds couple of lines of code, and we pass arguments into them from onsite,its a condition dont repeat your code.
  function getname(firstname,lastname){
    return firstname + ' '+ lastname;
}

function calculateAge(yearOfBirth){
    var age = 2016 -yearOfBirth;
    return age;
    
}
var megh=calculateAge(1979);
console.log(megh);

var name=getname('Megh','Thapa');
console.log(name + megh);
 
16.What is the difference between Statement and expression?
=> function somepar(par){ --> this is function statement 
    //code
   }
   
   var somefun=function(par){--> This is a  function expression
      //body
	  }
	 The difference between function and expression is expression creates a value or outcome unlike function statement just do function 
	 
	 For eg
	  3+4;
	  var x=3;-->This creates some immediate value 
	  
	 //Statement
     if(x=== 5){
	  //do something
	 }	
17.How do you create Arrays?
=> var names=['Ram','Shyam','Hari'];
   var years=[1979,1980,1981];

    for(i=0;i<names.length;i++){
    console.log(names[i]);
    }

     console.log(names);//This prints on 1 line 

18.What are the pre build function that you can use in Arrays?
=> push()--> add new elements in arrays 
   unshift()--> add elements at the beginning of the arrays	 
   pop()-->does not accept any parameters,removes last elements in the array and also returns removed value
   shift() --> removes 1st elements into the array 
   indexOf()->Return the position of the element if element is not present return -1;
   for eg var megh=['Megh','Thapa',37,true,'QA'];
   console.log(megh);

   if(megh.indexOf('QA')=== -1){
    console.log('Megh is a pilot');
   }

19.What are objects ?
=> object have key value pair.You can use "." operator to call each key.Objects can hold data as array 
   For eg:
   var megh = {
    name:'wassup',
    age: 37,
    ismarried:true,
    job: 'Engineer'
    
 
};
console.log(megh.name);
console.log(megh.age);

var xyz = 'job';
console.log(megh[xyz]);

20.How do you create array and function under object?
=> var megh = {
    name:'wassup',
    yearOfBirth: 1979,
    ismarried:true,
    job: 'Engineer',
    family:['Rajendra','Nirmala','Jyoti','Nirja'],
    calculationAge:function(yearOfBirth){
    return 2018-yearOfBirth;
 }
 
 };
  console.log(megh.family['2']);
 
 21.How do you declare loops and iteration ?
 => For loop:
    for(var i=0;i<10;i++){
	  
	}
	b)While loop
	  var i=0;
	  while(i<names.length){
	   console.log(names[i]);
	   i++;
	  }
	  
22.What are the javascript version ?
=> 1996 -> called livescript then javascript,
   1997 -> ECMAScript 1 become the 1st version 
   2009 -> ECMAScript 6 on 2015 big update ever 
    2016 -> ES 2016  

23.How JS work behind the scene ?
=> Javascript engine which run javascript code,There are many different engines out there like google 8,spider monkey.Our code is push through 
   Parser which means it reads our code line by line,it means parser know JS code how to read,Then it goes to Abstract syntax tree then convert into 
   machine code need to take classes 
   
24.What is DOM ?
=>It stands for document object model,Structured representation of an html document, The DOM is used to connect webpages to scripts like javascript. 
  for each HTML box ,there is an object in the DOM that we can access and interact with it.For eg: <a> 
  
25.What is the difference between textcontent and innerhtml?
=> Textcontent only prints text and innerhtml code changes format 
   //document.querySelector('#current-' + activeplayer).textcontent=dice;

   document.querySelector('#current-' + activeplayer).innerHTML='<em>'+dice+'</em>';
   
 26.What is querySelector means?
 => This is a method used to manupulate DOM, We can also read element from the web and store some variable 
 
 27.How do you change display properties ?
 => document.querySelector('.dice').style.display='none';
 
 28.What is Event?
 Notification that are sent to notify the code that something happen on the webpage.It will trigger by clicking a button,resiging the window,scrolling 
 down or pressing a key.We can use event listner to perform an action based on a certain event.it waits for a specific event to happen.like opening a pop
 up window.
 For eg: 
 document.querySelector('.btn-roll').addEventListner('click',) 
 you can choose eventlistner by going to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
 
 29.What is annonyms function?
 =>Function that does not have a name and cannot be reused 
  for eg document.querySelector('.btn-roll').addEventListener('click',function(){
    //Do something here 
});
