What is GitHub?
=>GitHub is a kind of server where number of company is register and they have created their git repository 

what is Git?
=> Git is a tool that will help you check in , checkout,pull version control 
BASIC COMMAND

1=>.$ git init // initialize Local Git Repository
2=>.$ git add <file>  //Add file(s) to index 
3 => .$ git status   // check status of working Tree
4 =>.$ git commit   // commit changes in index
5 -> .$ git push // Push to remote  repository
6 -> .$ git pull
7 -> git clone

What is the meaning of checkin?
=> push the code

what is meaning of checkout?
=> pull the code 

What is contineous integration ?
=>CI is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repositoty several times a day.
  Each check-in is then verified by an automated build,allowing teams to detect problems early and deliver the software early.
  
2.What are the benefits of CI?
- Catch issues fast and nip them in the bud
-Everyone can see what's happening
-Automate the build 
-Keep the build fast 
-Stop waiting to find out if your code's going to work 
-CI leads to Contineous deployment allowing to deliver software more rapidly 


3.What is Jenkins?
=>Jenkins is a cross platform CI application.Jenkins is used to build and test softwares contineously making it easier for developers to build softwares rapidly
  For eg: when developers push their code into version control system like (GIT/etc), when new build is pushed into git Jenkins will automatically pull those code and run the build.
  Also done some post build steps like Run test(Nunit,MSTest,Gradle,StyleCorp,Jshint)->Deploy (Publish output to live server) -> and report back
  
4.how do you run Jenkins?
=>Install war file from jenkins site and run below command into command prompt
  C:\Users\meght\Desktop>java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=9090(or what port number you want to run)
  
5.How do you configure maven project in Jenkins?
=> Go to manage jenkins->Global tool configuration -> Provide Java_Home as a name from environment variable 
  -> Go to the maven -> provide environment variable name for Maven  
  
6.How do you open a workspace and provide local file into Jenkins?
=> click new item->Enter item name -> click FreeStyle project->click advance->Use custom workspace ->go to the eclipse and copy project
  -> paste into the .jenkins folder-> Go to the Jenkins and on directory ${JENKINS_HOME}/ProjectEndtoEnd  
  -> Go to the build and select version of maven 
  -> On the goals you need to provide mvn command like test(you dont need to write mvn in jenkins)
  ->Go to the project and run your test 
      
7.why running jenkins standalone(jetty/winstone) VS Running jenkins on Tomcat ?
=> Benefit of running on Tomcat you can start all your application on a single servlet

8.How do you download Tomcat?
=>Go to tomcat download -> Select 64 bit windows zip -> unzip any location in the system -> Copy Jenkins.war file paste it inside webapps folder	  

9.How do you start Tomcat?
=> go to the tomcat and traverse through bin folder,under the bin folder you will find startup.sh or startup.sh 
  Another way open a command prompt traverse through folder to the bin then catalina.bat start command
  go to localhost and check if tomcat started 
  
10.How do you open jenkins from tomcat?
 => go to localhost/jenkins for eg: localhost:8080/jenkins 
 
11.Why DevOps is needed ?
=>When your requirement changes frequently 
  - Development needs to be Agile 
  - Operation need to be Agile 
  
12.What is DevOps?
=>Is a software development approach which involves continuous development,Continuous testing integration,Continuous deployment and continuous Monitoring of the software 
  throughout its development lifecycle.

13.What tools are used in DevOps?
=> for plan and code --> git,jira,svn
   For build --> Maven,gradle
   For test -> Selenium,Junit 
   For Integration -> Jenkins 
   For Deployment and Operate ->Puppet,chef,SalStacj,Ansible
   For Monitor-> New Relic,Sensu,Nagios
   
14.What are the phases of DevOps lifecycle?
-> Continuous development -> it comes under plan and code 
   Continuous Testing  -> Build and test comes under this 
   Continuous Integration-> Under integration
   Continuous Deployment -> comes under deploy and operate 
   Continuous Monitoring -> comes under monitor   
   
14.What is continuous development?
-> This phase involves 'planning ' and 'coding ' of the software application 
   -This version of the project is decided during the 'Planning' phase 
   - Code can be done in Any language but maintain by Version control system
   
15.What is continuous Testing?
=>Every time when you commit your changes into the central repo or a build, Everytime when you push the code, it would run some regression,sanity or smoke test it is called continues
  testing.Because you are continue testing the build or small set of test everyday
  
16.What is continues Integration?
=>This can be achieve through Jenkins  

17.What is continues Deployment?
-> Configuration -> like server maintenance, 
   Containerization -> Containerization tools is a set of tools which will maintain the consistency across the environment.
    Docker is the first Containerization tool in the market 

18.What are the basic terminology of GIT?
=>	There are 3 stages of GIT
    1.Working directory-> Where you store your source file 
	2.Staging Area -> Pre commit Holding Area
	3.Commit -GIT Repository(History)
	4.Remote Repositiry(GitHub)
	
19.What is branch?
-> This is where you commit your changes.It git you can have multiple branch 

20.What is Distributed version control ?
=> In Distributed VCS, every contributor has a local copy or "Clone" of the main repository 

21.What is centralized version control?
=> It is where all the source code is used in Central repository like GIT

51.What is Git branch?
=>Lets say we have a 20 developers working on a team,If everybody is pushing their code into Master and something happened into the code, if you have to revert those code then all 
  the code committed by all the developers. thats why the branching strategy have been developed.So the Dev will keep working on their branches, When it is needed then we will 
  move those code into the master.
