How do you run python code ?
-> You can run with IDLE(Core IDE ) or using INtellij 

2.What is Python?
=> It is object oriented interpreted language,It is much easier to learn compare to other languages. It runs on many operating system like mac, Windows,Linux.Python supports 
   basic data types such as number and strings and also support most complex type like list dictionary it also supports multiple inheritance. It is a dynamically type language 
   you dont have to worry about type conversion.Most of the programming is done in python 2.7 and it will continue to support till 2020   
   
3.How do you print in python?
=> print('Hello Megh !')
  print(2+3)
  print()
  print(2 % 11)
  print("The End")
  print("Python's strings are easy to use")
  print('We can even include "quotes" in strings')
  print("Hello"+" world")
  greetings = "Hello"
  name = "World"
#This is a demo of the comment 
  print(greetings +" "+name)
  you can declare string with "" or '' it does not matter 
  
4. how do you add comment?
=>#This is a demo of the comment  

5.What is input method does?
-> It will allow you to type in the console 

6.How do you split string ?
->splitname="This string\nwill split\n in lines"

7.How do you use tab in string?
->"1\t2\t3\t4"

8.How do you type "" under a ''?
=> print('The pet shop owner said "No,no,\'e\'s uh...he\s resting')
print("The pet shop owner said\"No,no,'e's uh,...he's resting\"")

9.How do you print string without using above function ?
=>anotherSplitString="""This string has been
  split over
  several lines"""
  print(anotherSplitString)
  
10.What are the rules of creating variable?
-  Each variable name should be start with lowercase or underscore 
- Cannot start with number 
- Megh45,Megh_thapa_37 is a valid variable name
  greeting ="Megh"
  _myName="Megh"
  my_Name="Thapa"
  name45="12"
  name_first_name="Samyra"
  
11.How many datatypes in Python?
=>  Numeric,Sequences(String being a sequence type),Mappings,classes,Instances and exceptions

12.Explain Numeric data types ?
-> Int,long,float and complex number,In python 3 no longer int as a long as a data type

13.Explain Int 
-> a=12
b=3
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)#If you put "/" it will return float
print(a//b)# "//" will return whole number
print(a % b)

14.How do you create a loop in python?
=> for i in range(1,4)
   print i;
   
15.How do you create variable and strings ?
=> parrot="Norwegian blue"
print(parrot)
print(parrot[0])#print first index
print(parrot[3])#print 3rd index
print(parrot[-1])#print last index
print(parrot[0:6])#This will print from index 0 to 6
print(parrot[:6])#This will print from index 0 to 6
print(parrot[6:])#This will print from after index 6
print(parrot[-4:-2])#This will print last index-2
print(parrot[0:6:2])#Start index is 0,6 will be the length,2 will skip index

number="9,223,372,036,854,775,807"
print(number[1::4])
numbers="1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"
print(numbers[0::3])

string1="he's"
string2=" probably"
print(string1+string2)

print("he's" " probably" " pining")#You can add string without using + operator
print("Hello " * 5)#multiply string 5 times

today="Friday"
print("day" in today)#Checks if day in today return true or false
print("Fri" in today)#
print("parrot" in "asdf")#Comapare strings return true or false 

16.How do you format String in python?
=> print("There are {0} days in {1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6} and {7}".format(31,"January","March","may", -->{0}->Takes first value from the list and so on 
        "july","August","October","December"))
		print("My age is {0} years".format(age))#{0}->Put age in
	Another way of doing 
    print("""
 january:{2}
 February :{0}
 march:{2}
 April:{1}
 May:{2}
 June:{2}
 July:{2}
 september:{1}
  October:{2}
 November:{1}
 December:{2}
""".format(28,30,31))	

17.What does str()method does in python?
=> it will convert int to String 
   age =30
  print("My age is "+str(age) +" Years")

18.What is %d and %s ?
=>%d => Refers to current variable 
  %S => Refers to string 
  **=> square root  
  %2d=>allocating a number in front of %d for formatting you can also used {0:2} or (1:4) and use .format() method which is old approach
  for eg:
  print("My age is %d years" % age)
  print("My age is %d %s, %d %s" %(age,"Years",6,"Month"))
  print("My age is %d years" % age)
print("My age is %d %s, %d %s" %(age,"Years",6,"Month"))

for i in range(1,12):
        print("No.%d square in %4d and cubed is %4d" %(i,i **2,i**3))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program flow statement 
----------------------------
19.What is indent ?
=> Lets say you start a loop it must have to have atleast a space to know python that this is a statement, if you dont give space you will get a compilation error 
   for eg:
   for i in range(1,12):
 print("this is {0} square in {1} and cubed in {2}".format(i,i**2,i**3))

20.How do you change indentation ?
File->Setting-> Editor->Code style-> python -> select smart tabs 

21.How do you define if statement?
-> name=input("please enter your name: ")
age=int(input("how old are you {0}? ".format(name)))
print(age)

if age >=18:
    print("You are old enough to vote")
else:
    print("Please come back in {0} years".format(18-age))
	 
22.How do you convert string to int?
=> by using int
   for eg:
    age=int(input("how old are you {0}? ".format(name))) 
	
23.How do you intialize if elif statement?
=> print("Guess a number between 1 to 10")
guess=int(input())

if(guess<5):
    print("please guess higher")
    guess=int(input())
    if guess == 5:
        print("you guess a correct number,you guessed it")
    else:
        print("You havent guess correctly")
elif guess > 5:
    print("please guess lower")
    guess=int(input())
    if guess==5:
        print("well done you guessed it ")
    else:
        print("you have not guess correctly")
else:
    print("you got it first time")	
	
Instead of using if we can use following code too 
# if (age>=16) and (age <=65):
if 16 <=age <=65:	
	
24.How do you return boolean ?
=> print(not False)
   print(not True)	
   
25.How do you declare for loop?
=>  for i in range(1,20):
    print("i is {}".format(i)) 
	
   number=9,10,11,18,12,13,14,15,16,17
string="Megh,Sangam,Samyra,mom"
for i in range(0,len(number)):
    print(number[i])
for i in range(0,len(string)):
    print(string[i])
for i in range(0,len(number)):
    if number[i] in "0123456789":
        clearednumber=clearednumber+number[i]
        print(clearednumber)
newnumber=int(clearednumber)-->Converts string to int 
print("the new number is {}".format(newnumber))	

26.How do you loop char ?
=>number="9,10,11,18,12,13,14,15,16,17"
   clearednumber=''
   for char in number:
    if char in '1234567890':
        clearednumber=clearednumber+char

newNumber=int(clearednumber)
print("the new number is {}".format(newNumber))
